 <p class="lead">Hi! My name is Janara Manuel Escano, and I am 21 years old. 
I live in Bongalon, Labrador, Pangasinan. 
My mother's name is Mildred M. Escano and she is totally blind. 
She was a college graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering, 
and my father's name is Renato D. Escano, and he is not a college graduate. 
They have nine children, and I am the seventh.
I studied in elementary in Bongalon Elementary School, but I did not receive an award because
 I had many absences, such as going to school twice a week, 
 but I am active in sports, such as volleyball, and I am always competing in other schools.
 I graduated in elementary year 2012-2013.

 I was not active in class and was not awarded throughout my school years. 
 But, as before, I competed in volleyball at another school.
  I graduated from high school in the 2016-2017 school year. 
  I graduated from senior high school with a Strand of 
  Technical Vocational Lively Hood(Fish Processing) 
  with honors in the 2018-2019 school year.
